The MinPy homework for CS231n Winter 2016

Date: Aug. 28, 2016

This homework is based on the [assignemnts](http://http://cs231n.github.io/) of CS231n Winter 2016. [CS 231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) is a Stanford course taught by Fei-Fei Li, Andrej Karpathy, and Justin Johnson. This tutorial is built on the original `numpy` version of CS 231n assignments and demonstrate how to use `minpy` to speed up the common machine learning experiments with GPU acceleration and auto derivation of gradient function.

This homework has a companion solution. Please contact Professor @zzhang-cn for details.
